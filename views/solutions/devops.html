						<p>The DevOps paradigm is designed to create an agile, highly responsive environment for <strong> application development, testing, deployment and operations. </strong>  This "brave new world" moves traditional IT and application developers closer together, creating significant opportunity for organizations to focus on creating a competitive advantage.</p>

						<p>In a DevOps environment, application developers focus on the code they write.  A single application can be created and wrapped in a container such as Docker and rapidly deployed throughout the infrastructure, <strong> scaling to thousands of instances.</strong>  Orchestration tools communicate with the infrastructure assigning compute, storage and networking resources as needed.  The primary motivator for the developers is the performance and scalability of the application that they wrote.</p>

						<p><strong>This approach is very different from the traditional IT view. </strong> Traditionally, IT has been primarily concerned with the utilization of individual resources or silos.  Server virtualization has been leveraged to improve server utilization by running multiple virtual environments on a single server platform.  Separate storage solutions deliver the data needed; and separate network technologies are used to connect everything together.  While this approach has been somewhat effective in the past, the world of DevOps requires a much more agile, elastic and hyper-converged approach to the infrastructure.</p>

						<h4>In a DevOps environment:</h4>
						<ul class="points">
							<li>Infrastructure must instantly be able to handle any type of workload (virtualized or container-based).</li>
							<li>Provisioning of infrastructure must be automatic and happen in 1-2 seconds, as compared to today's manual processes involving days or even weeks.</li>
							<li>Resource utilization must be monitored in real time with balancing taking place in a sub-second manner.</li>
						</ul>
