						<p>The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) has seen rapid adaptation due to the flurry of interconnected devices, ranging from mobile phones to household appliance. It is estimated that by 2020 we will have more than 25 billion connected devices, shaping the driving force associated with IoT as a concept. These interconnected devices pose a significant challenge, one that the IT industry has not seen before. </p>

						<p>The Internet of Things marks the beginning of an era in which sensors, devices, and people are being connected through the Internet to share events and data, thereby creating newer experiences and unparalleled growth opportunities for individuals and businesses. </p>
